## 📘 Basic Overview


<br>

Given a real estate dataset, to create a multiple linear regression (similar to the one in the lecture). The dependent variable is 'price', while the independent variables are 'size' and 'year'.

-  Display the intercept and coefficient(s)
-  Find the R-squared and Adjusted R-squared
-  Compare the R-squared and the Adjusted R-squared
-  Compare the R-squared of this regression and the simple linear regression where only 'size' was used
-  Using the model make a prediction about an apartment with size 750 sq.ft. from 2009
-  Find the univariate (or multivariate if you wish - see the article) p-values of the two variables. 
-  Create a summary table with your findings
